This Python code extracts the palette of colors from an image file and displays it visually using Matplotlib. 
The code uses the Pillow library to load an image file and the colorthief library to extract the color palette.

After opening the image file, the code uses the ColorThief class from the colorthief library 
to extract the palette of colors from the image. The get_palette() method is called on the ColorThief object 
with an argument of color_count=8 to specify the number of colors to extract.

The code then creates a Matplotlib figure and adds a rectangle for each color in the palette. 
The color of each rectangle is set using the RGB values of the corresponding color in the palette. 

The RGB values are also displayed underneath each color rectangle.

The resulting plot is displayed using the plt.show() method.

Note that the image file must be in the same directory as the Python script and should be specified in both the Image.open() and ColorThief() methods.
